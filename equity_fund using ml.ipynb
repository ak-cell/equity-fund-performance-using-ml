    "3)Launch_Date: The date on which the scheme has begun.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Net_Assets_(Cr): Assets under management (AUM), sometimes called funds under management (FUM), measures the total market value of all the financial assets which a financial institution such as a mutual fund, venture capital firm, or broker manages on behalf of its clients and themselves.\n",

    "11)Alpha:Alpha measures the difference between the fund's actual returns and its expected performance,given its level of risk which is measured as Beta. A positive Alpha indicates that the fund has performed better than the Beta would predict. A negative Alpha indicates that the fund has underperformed given the expectations established by funds's Beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "12)Beta:Beta measures the responsiveness of a stock's price to changes in the overall stock market. On comparison of the benchmark index for e.g. NSE Nifty to a particular stock returns, a pattern develops that shows the stock's openness to the market risk. This helps the investor to decide whether he wants to go for the riskier stock that is highly correlated with the market (beta above 1), or with a less volatile one (beta below 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a stock's beta value is 1.3, it means, theoretically this stock is 30% more volatile than the market. Beta calculation is done by regression analysis which shows security's response with that of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "By multiplying the beta value of a stock with the expected movement of an index, the expected change in the value of the stock can be determined. For example, if beta is 1.3 and the market is expected to move up by 10%, then the stock should move up by 13% (1.3 x 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "13)R_Squared:R-squared measures the relationship between a portfolio and its benchmark. It can be thought of as a percentage from 1 to 100.R-squared is not a measure of the performance of a portfolio. A great portfolio can have a very low R-squared. It is simply a measure of the correlation of the portfolio's returns to the benchmark's returns.R-squared can be used to ascertain the significance of a particular beta or alpha. Generally, a higher R-squared will indicate a more useful beta figure. If the R-squared is lower, then the beta is less relevant to the fund's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "14)Std_Dev: Standard deviation (SD) is a measure of volatility of how far the measurement such as return tends to deviate from an average over particular period.\n",
    "\n",
    "15)Sharpe_Ratio:Sharpe ratio is the measure of risk-adjusted return of a financial portfolio. A portfolio with a higher Sharpe ratio is considered superior relative to its peers.Sharpe ratio is a measure of excess portfolio return over the risk-free rate relative to its standard deviation. Normally, the 90-day Treasury bill rate is taken as the proxy for risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "16)Category:A fund category is a way of differentiating mutual funds according to their investment objectives and principal investment features. This categorization allows investors to spread their money around in a mix of funds with a variety of risk and return characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "17)Consitency: Consistency indicates whether the AMC is constantly performing or not by giving constant returns to the depositers.\n",
    "\n",
    "18)Year Trailing: Indicates how old is the scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "19)Sortino_Ratio:Sortino ratio is the statistical tool that measures the performance of the investment relative to the downward deviation. Unlike Sharpe, it doesn't take into account the total volatility in the investment.\n",
    "Sortino ratio is similar to Sharpe ratio, except while Sharpe ratio uses standard deviation in the denominator, Frank A Sortino uses downside deviation in the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation involves both the upward as well as the downward volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since investors are only concerned about the downward volatility, Sortino ratio presents a more realistic picture of the downside risk ingrained in the fund or the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "20)Net_Returns:It typically includes capital gains and any income received from the investment. By comparison, the net rate of return deducts fees and expenses from the investment's final value. For net return, not only fees and commissions are deducted, but also the effects of taxes and inflation.\n",
